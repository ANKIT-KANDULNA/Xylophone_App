## 💡 Thought Process  

I wanted to build something **simple yet interactive** that:  
- Helps me **practice Flutter basics** (widgets, layouts, assets).  
- Uses **sound/audio integration** for a real-world feature.  
- Has a **visually appealing design** (rainbow-colored buttons 🌈).  

While brainstorming, I realized a **xylophone** is perfect:  
- Fixed number of notes (7 buttons).  
- Each note maps easily to an audio file.  
- Colorful UI keeps it fun and engaging.

## ⚙️ Development Journey  

1. **UI Design**  
   - Decided on a **Column layout** with 7 `Expanded` widgets (equal-sized buttons).  
   - Used **different vibrant colors** for each button for better UX.  

2. **Audio Integration**  
   - Explored `audioplayers` package.  
   - Linked each button press to a specific `.wav` file.  

3. **Challenges**  
   - Understanding Flutter’s asset system (needed to update `pubspec.yaml`).  
   - Initial lag in audio playback → fixed with `audioplayers` settings.  

4. **What I Learned**  
   - Handling **assets in Flutter** (sounds/images).  
   - Creating **reusable functions** (one function to play any note instead of repeating code).  
   - Building clean, responsive layouts with `Expanded` widgets.
